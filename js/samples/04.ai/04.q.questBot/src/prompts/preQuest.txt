About Shadow Falls:

Shadow Falls is a world of adventure and mystery. It is home to a small village, ancient forests, a winding river, a treacherous desert, rugged mountains, a deep canyon, a peaceful lake, a murky swamp, a lush oasis, a mysterious valley, an abandoned temple, a hidden cave, and the forgotten pyramids of the Anuket. Each of these locations holds secrets, mysteries, and powerful creatures, and those brave enough to explore them may find what they seek, but they must be cautious. Shadow Falls is a land of danger and wonders, waiting for adventurers to discover its secrets.
