# BotBuilder-m365

This SDK is designed to help you build bots that can interact with Teams and Microsoft 365 apps. It is built on top of the [Bot Framework SDK](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-js) to make it easier to build Teams and M365-interacting bots.

The SDK also facilitates the creation of bots that uses an [OpenAI](https://openai.com/api/) API key to provide an AI-driven conversational experience, or the same using Azure Foundry.

This SDK is currently in preview and is subject to change. We welcome your feedback and contributions!

## Getting Started

Head over to the js folder to see the SDK code and try out our samples.

During FHL, we're looking for feedback and robust samples that can showcase best practices and common scenarios for using this SDK with OpenAI. The [OfficeDev](https://github.com/orgs/OfficeDev/repositories?language=&q=microsoft-teams-apps&sort=&type=all) repo has many Teams samples that we should re-engineer to use this SDK.

FHL samples will be considered for adding to our samples category in this repo.
